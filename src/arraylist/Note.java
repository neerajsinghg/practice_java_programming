	 *  What are the important features of ArrayList in Java?

	Answer: There are several significant features of ArrayList in Java that are as follows:

	a) ArrayList in Java uses an index-based structure.

	b) The size of ArrayList can increase or decrease at runtime. Once ArrayList is created, we can add any number of elements.

	c) An ArrayList allows adding elements into the middle of collection.

	d) It allows to delete elements.

	e) Duplicate elements are allowed in the array list.

	f) Any number of null elements can be added to ArrayList.

	g) ArrayList maintains the insertion order in Java. That is insertion order is preserved.

	h) ArrayList is not synchronized. That means multiple threads can use the same ArrayList objects simultaneously.

	i) Since ArrayList implements random access interface, we can get, set, insert, and remove elements of the array list from any arbitrary position.

	j) The performance of ArrayList is slow because if any element is removed from ArrayList, a lot of shifting takes place.
	
	h) Retrieval (getting) of elements is very fast in ArrayList

	 *  What is the main difference between ArrayList and LinkedList data structures in Java?
Answer: The main differences between ArrayList and LinkedList in java are as follows:

a) An ArrayList is an index-based dynamic array whereas LinkedList is a doubly-linked list data structure.

b) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store elements whereas, LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.

c) ArrayList is not efficient for manipulation because it provides slow manipulation due to a lot of shifting taking place. Whereas,

LinkedList provides faster manipulation as compared to ArrayList. Therefore, it is efficient for manipulation.

d) ArrayList is better for storing and fetching (or accessing) elements (or data). Whereas, LinkedList is better for manipulating data.

e) ArrayList uses random access but LinkedList does not.

f) Since ArrayList stores only object, therefore, it takes less memory. But, LinkedList stores the object and the address of that object, so it takes more memory.

g) ArrayList implements only the List interface. So, it acts as a list only. Whereas, LinkedList implements both List and Deque interfaces. Therefore, it acts as list and queue both.

	 * What is the difference between Arrays and Collections in Java?
Or, Explain the difference between Collections and Arrays.

Answer: The main difference between arrays and collections are as follows:

a) Arrays are fixed in size/length but collections are growable in nature. We can increase or decrease size based on our requirements.

b) Arrays are not recommended to use with respect to memory whereas collections are recommended to use with respect to memory.

c) Arrays are recommended to use with respect to performance but collections are not recommended to use with respect to performance.

d) Arrays can store only homogeneous data elements (similar type of data) but collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous elements.

e) Arrays do not support any method whereas collections support numerous types of methods.

g) Arrays can hold both primitives and object types whereas, collections can hold only objects but not primitive.
